        <h2>Crown shyness</h2>

                <b>Crown shyness</b> (also <i>canopy disengagement</i>,<sup>[1]
                </sup><i>canopy shyness</i>, <sup>[2]</sup> or <i>inter-crown 
                spacing</i><sup>[3]</sup>) is a phenomenon observed in 
                some tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees
                do not touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like 
                gaps.<sup>[4][5]</sup> The phenomenon is most prevalent among 
                trees of the same species, but also occurs between trees of 
                different species.<sup>[6][7]</sup>There exist many hypotheses
                as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research 
                suggests that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect 
                larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>

            <h3>Possible phsiological explanations</h3>
            <hr>

            <p>
             The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.
             <sup>[6]</sup> The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific
             literature since the 1920s.<sup>[9]</sup> The variety of hypotheses
             and experimental results might suggest that there are multiple 
             mechanisms across different species, an example of convergent 
             evolution.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

                Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy
                branches leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees: trees 
                in windy areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each 
                other during winds; the abrasions and collisions induce a crown 
                shyness response. Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is 
                largely uninfluenced by neighbours until disturbed by mechanical 
                abrasion.<sup>[10]</sup> If the crowns are artificially 
                prevented from colliding in the winds, they gradually fill the 
                canopy gaps.<sup>[11]</sup> This explains instances of crown 
                shyness between branches of the same organism. Proponents of 
                this idea cite that shyness is particularly seen in conditions 
                conducive to this pruning, including windy forests, stands of 
                flexible trees, and early succession forests where branches are 
                flexible and limited in lateral movement.<sup>[6][12]</sup> 
                According to this theory, variable flexibility in lateral 
                branches greatly influences the degree of crown shyness.

                A 2015 study has suggested that <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> 
                shows different leaf placement strategies when grown amongst 
                kin and unrelated conspecifics, shading dissimilar neighbors and 
                avoiding kin. This response was shown to be contingent on the 
                proper functioning of multiple photosensory modalities.
                <sup>[21]</sup> A 1998 study proposed similar systems of 
                photoreceptor-mediated inhibition of growth as explanations of 
                crown shyness, <sup>[6][20]</sup> though a causal link between 
                photoreceptors and crown asymmetry had yet to be experimentally 
                proven. This might explain instances of intercrown spacing that 
                are only exhibited between conspecifics.<sup>[6][7]</sup>
