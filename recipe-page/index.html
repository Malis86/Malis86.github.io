            <h1>COOKING THE PASTA PERFECTLY</h1>
            <p>
                Let's start with the pasta. Bring a big pot of salted water
                to a rolling boil. Remember, you want the water salty like
                the sea to infuse the pasta with flavor from the inside out.
                Large wlbow macaroni is my go-to for that classic look and 
                bite, but feel free to get creative! Here are a few other
            pasta shapes that work great:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Cavatappi</b> (corkscrews): These are perfecT for 
                    catching all the creamy sauce in their curves.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Penne</b> or <b>rigatoni:</b> Their hollow centers 
                    are great for holding onto that luscious cheese sauce.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Shells:</b> They create little pockects that soak up
                    all the cheesy goodness.
                </li>
                <p>
                    Regardless of which shape you choose, cook it at al dente or 
                    a minute under since it'll continue to cook in the oven. 
                    This way, it won't end up overcooked and mushy. Once your 
                    pasta is ready, drain it thoroughly but don't rinse it. The 
                    starch left on the pasta will help the sauce cling better!
                </p>
                <h1>CREATING A DREAMY CHEESE SAUCE</h1>
                <p>
                    Here's a tip: <b>whisk in minced garlic</b> after your roux
                    has cooked to infuse it with flavor before adding the 
                    liquid. You can also saute the garlic in the butter before 
                    adding the flour if that's wasier for you. Slowly pour in 
                    warm heavy cream while whisking continuously to avoid lumps. 
                    <b>TRUST ME</b> using warm cream instead of cold makes all 
                    the difference- it helps the sauce stay smooth and prevents 
                    it from breaking.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    Once the cream is incorporated, mix in the softened cream 
                    cheese for that extra creamy texture. Then,season it up with 
                    a mix of dry mustard powder, smoked paprika, a hint of 
                    nutmeg, and a dash of cayenne for a subtle kick. These 
                    spices elevate the flavor profile without overpowering it. 
                    Season with salt and pepper to taste. <b>DON'T</b> go too 
                    crazy with the salt though because keep in mind, the cheese 
                    will melt in and naturally salt the sauce. You 
                    can always add more salt later at the end after tasting.
                </p>
            
                <h1>CHEESE SELECTION & GRATING TIPS</h1>
                <p>
                    Here's the fun part: cheese! I love using a blend of sharp
                    cheddar, colby jack, and smoked gouda, but there are so many
                    delicious options out there:
                </p>

                <b>Creamy, Melty Cheeses:</b> These cheeses melt beautifully
                and give your sauce a smooth, velvety texture:               
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Fontina:</b> Buttery and rich with a slighty nutty
                        flavor.
                    </li>  
                    <li>
                        <b>Gruyère:</b> Adds a nutty, slightly salty taste, 
                        perfect for a more sophisticated flavor profile.
                    </li>
                    <li>    
                        <b>Mozzarella:</b> Super gooey with a mild flavor — 
                        great for that stretchy, melty goodness.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Monterey Jack:</b> Mild with a creamy texture, great 
                        for adding extra meltiness.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Havarti:</b> Buttery and soft, with a delicate flavor 
                        that pairs well with other cheeses.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <b>Bold, Flavorful Cheeses:</b> These cheeses pack more 
                    of a punch and add depth to your mac and cheese:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Pecorino Romano:</b> Sharp and salty, a little goes a 
                        long way! It adds a nice tang.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Parmesan: Nutty and salty, perfect for adding an umami 
                        boost. Best sprinkled on top.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Asiago:</b> Sharp with a nutty, buttery flavor, 
                        perfect if you want a bolder taste.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>White Cheddar:</b> Stronger and tangier than regular 
                        cheddar, adds a rich depth.
                    </li>
                </ul>        
                <p>   
                    <b>Tip:</b> Always grate your own cheese instead of using 
                    pre-shredded. Pre-shredded cheese is coated with anti-caking
                    agents that prevent it from melting smoothly. Grating your 
                    own cheese not only melts better but also has a fresher 
                    taste. It might take a few extra minutes, but it's totally 
                    worth it for that silky, smooth sauce.
                </p>

                <p>    
                    To finish the sauce, reduce the heat to low and gradually 
                    stir in the shredded cheeses. Keep stirring until everything
                    is completely melted and velvety smooth. At this point, 
                    taste and adjust any seasonings to your liking.
                </p>
                <h1>ASSEMBLING & BAKING</h1>
            
                <p>
                    With the pasta cooked and the sauce ready, combine 
                    everything in a large baking dish, making sure each piece of 
                    pasta is generously coated. For the topping, sprinkle on 
                    more shredded cheese. You can stick with a single type like 
                    Colby Jack or mix a few varieties to get that melty, golden 
                    crust. I recommend using a cheese that is more creamy on top 
                    so it melts better without drying out under the broiler like 
                    Colby Jack, Monterrey Jack, or even Mozzarella.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bake it in the oven until everything is bubbling and heated 
                    through. For that perfect crispy finish, switch to broil for
                    a couple of minutes — just keep a close watch to avoid 
                    burning it. The broiled top adds a wonderful contrast to the
                    creamy interior!
                </p>

                <h1>EXTRA TIPS, VARIATIONS & TRICKS</h1>
                <b>Add-ins for extra flavor:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Caramelized onions for a more sweet note.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Stir in cooked chicken or lobster if you're feeling 
                        fancy and need some protein!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For some green, fold in chopped and blanched broccoli.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mix in some butternut squash puree for butternut squash 
                        mac and cheese!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>   
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Make it crunchy:</b> Mix up a breadcrumb topping 
                            for extra crunch. Combine panko breadcrumbs with 
                            melted butter, garlic powder, and a sprinkle of 
                            Parmesan. Add it on top before baking. I personally 
                            am not a fan of breadcrumbs on Mac & Cheese but here 
                            is the option if you like it.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h1>MAKE-AHEAD & STRONG LEFTOVERS</h1>
                <p>
                    This mac and cheese is great for making ahead. You can 
                    prepare everything up to the baking step, cover it 
                    tightly with foil, and store it in the fridge for up to 
                    a day. When you're ready to serve, bake straight from 
                    he fridge, adding a few extra minutes to the bake time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For leftovers (if you're lucky enough to have any!), 
                    store in an airtight container in the fridge. When 
                    reheating, add a splash of milk or cream to bring back 
                    that creamy consistency. You can warm it up in the oven 
                    or microwave — just be careful not to overheat, or the 
                    sauce can separate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This dish also freezes beautifully! Let it cool completely 
                    before transferring to an airtight container. It'll keep in 
                    the freezer for a couple of months. When you're ready to 
                    enjoy, let it thaw overnight in the fridge and reheat in the 
                    oven covered with foil to keep it from drying out or pop it 
                    in the microwave.
                </p>
                <h1>LET'S DIG IN!</h1>
                <p>
                    Serve it fresh out of the oven, and get ready for all the 
                    oohs and ahhs. The combination of creamy pasta, rich cheese 
                    sauce, and that crispy top is pure comfort. Pair it with a 
                    light salad or roasted veggies for a balanced meal, or go 
                    all out with your favorite mains. No matter how you serve 
                    it, this baked mac and cheese is sure to be a hit!

                                Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add 
                                pasta and cook a minute below al dente. The 
                                pasta will finish cooking in the oven.

                                Heat a saucepan or pot over medium heat. Add the 
                                butter. Once melted, whisk in the flour and cook 
                                for 2 to 3 minutes until it just starts to 
                                bubble and turns a yellow-golden color.

                                continuously until smooth. Then add the cream 
                                cheese, dry mustard powder, smoked paprika, 
                                black pepper, nutmeg, cayenne powder, and salt. 
                                Whisk together until smooth. Continue to cook 
                                the sauce for 3 to 4 minutes or until it 
                                thickens.

                            <li>
                                Once the pasta is done cooking, drain it and 
                                toss it into the sauce immediately. Mix together 
                                in a large baking dish.

                                Cover the top with your shredded cheese of 
                                choice. I personally love opting for just Colby 
                                Jack or a blend of the three cheeses.

                                Bake at 350°F for 15 minutes. Then turn to broil 
                                for a few minutes just until the top is golden 
                                and crispy - make sure to monitor it closely.
