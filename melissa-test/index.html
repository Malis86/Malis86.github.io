        <h5>About Me:</h5>
        <p>
            Traveling to different places around the world is one of my greatest
            passions. Each destination offers a unique landscape, culture, and 
            atmosphere that fuels my creativity. Whether it's the vibrant 
            streets of a bustling city or the serene beauty of a remote 
            countryside, these experiences deeply inspire me. I find that 
            immersing myself in new surroundings allows me to envision and 
            create a variety of scenes for my matte paintings, capturing the 
            essence of each location in my artwork.
