            <h1>Meet Joy</h1>
            <p>
                Joy got her name because she brings so much happiness 
                to those around her. She has a special ability to lift 
                anyone's spirits and turn a bad mood into a joyful one. 
                Joy is a 2-year-old Border Collie who is friendly, 
                well-trained, and has plenty of energy. She loves to 
                cuddle up on the couch with you. About a year ago, 
                she was surrendered to us by her previous owners, 
                who were elderly and unable to handle her energetic nature.
