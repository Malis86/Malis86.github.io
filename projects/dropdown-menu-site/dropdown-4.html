            <p>
                Primm is an energetic 6-month-old Siberian Husky with a
                passion for running and staying active. Due to her high
                energy levels, it's essential to keep her cool during
                warm weather to ensure her comfort and well-being. She has
                a playful nature and particularly enjoys playing fetch, 
                showcasing her agility and love for interaction. 
                Primm is very sociable and gets along wonderfully with 
                other dogs and even cats, making her an ideal addition to 
                multi-pet households. With her friendly disposition and 
                enthusiasm for outdoor activities, Primm would make an 
                excellent companion for those who enjoy regular walks or 
                jogging. She thrives on companionship and exercise, 
                making each outing a fun adventure for both of you.
