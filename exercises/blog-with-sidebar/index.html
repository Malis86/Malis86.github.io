                    In this animated film, Chanticleer (Glen Campbell), 
                    a barnyard rooster, has convinced the other animals 
                    that his crowing makes the sun rise. When, one day, 
                    he forgets to crow and the sun comes up anyway, 
                    the secret is out. He heads for the big city in 
                    shame. But as massive storms and dark clouds stop 
                    the sun from appearing, the farm animals get worried, 
                    so a mouse named Peepers (Sandy Duncan) and a kitten 
                    called Edmond (Toby Scott Granger) lead the gang on 
                    a trip to find Chanticleer in the city.

                    My sisters and I would watch this movie over and over
                    agian. The anitatioin was great and the music was
                    something we would dance to. <b>8/10</b> Would
                    recommend.

                    On his birthday, Omri (Hal Scardino) is given several 
                    simple gifts, including an old wooden cupboard and a 
                    small plastic figurine of a Native American man. When 
                    he locks the toy inside the cabinet it magically comes 
                    to life as a tiny, cagey warrior named Little Bear 
                    (Litefoot). The boy then places other toys in the 
                    cupboard and they too come to life, even engaging in 
                    entertaining battles. But after Little Bear is wounded, 
                    Omri begins to understand that his animate toys are not 
                    mere playthings.

                    This is a very unrated movie. For the time it was made, it 
                    had great detail in their computer graphics. It made you 
                    want a magical cupboard as well!<b>9/10</b> Would recommend.

                    This movie made my sisters and go to the edge of our seat 
                    and cry at the same time. The is one we only watched a few
                    times, but is a really good movie in the end.<b>7/10</b>
