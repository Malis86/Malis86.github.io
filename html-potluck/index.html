                1 tablespoon red wine vinegar

        <ol>
            <li>
                Make the pizza: Place an inverted baking sheet or pizza stone on 
                the lowest oven rack; preheat to 475 degrees F. Stretch the 
                pizza dough into an 11-by-15-inch rectangle on a floured piece 
                of parchment paper; trim any excess paper around the dough. 
                Transfer the dough (on the parchment) to a pizza peel or another 
                inverted baking sheet and slide the dough and parchment onto the 
                hot baking sheet. Bake until browned in spots, 10 to 12 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over 
                medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up into 
                pieces with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink, about 
                4 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the crust from the oven. Spread the ricotta on top, 
                leaving a 1-inch border. Sprinkle with the mozzarella, provolone 
                and parmesan; top with the sausage and garlic. Return the pizza 
                to the oven and bake until the cheese is bubbling, 
                8 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle with the oregano.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, make the salad: Soak the red onion in ice water for 
                10 minutes, then drain. Toss the spinach, fennel, roasted red 
                peppers, artichoke hearts and red onion in a large bowl with the 
                vinegar and olive oil; season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Top the pizza with the salad and cut into pieces. Sprinkle with 
                red pepper flakes.
            </li>
