            </li>
            <li>
                4 cups baby spinach (about 21/2 ounces)
            </li>
            <li>
                1 small bulb fennel, trimmed, cored and thinly sliced
            </li>
            <li>
                1/2 cup chopped raosted red peppers
            </li>
            <li>
                3/4 cup quartered marinated artichoke hearts, drained and halved
            </li>
            <li>
                1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
            </li>
            <li>
                Kopsher salt and freshly ground pepper 
            </li>
            <li>
                Red pepper flakes, for topping
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Make the pizza: Place an inverted baking sheet or pizza stone on 
                the lowest oven rack; preheat to 475 degrees F. Stretch the 
                pizza dough into an 11-by-15-inch rectangle on a floured piece 
                of parchment paper; trim any excess paper around the dough. 
                Transfer the dough (on the parchment) to a pizza peel or another 
                inverted baking sheet and slide the dough and parchment onto the 
                hot baking sheet. Bake until browned in spots, 10 to 12 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over 
                medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up into 
                pieces with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink, about 
                4 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the crust from the oven. Spread the ricotta on top, 
                leaving a 1-inch border. Sprinkle with the mozzarella, provolone 
                and parmesan; top with the sausage and garlic. Return the pizza 
                to the oven and bake until the cheese is bubbling, 
                8 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle with the oregano.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, make the salad: Soak the red onion in ice water for 
                10 minutes, then drain. Toss the spinach, fennel, roasted red 
                peppers, artichoke hearts and red onion in a large bowl with the 
                vinegar and olive oil; season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Top the pizza with the salad and cut into pieces. Sprinkle with 
                red pepper flakes.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Kosher salt 
            </li>
            <li>
                1 pound spaghetti
            </li>
            <li>
                3 cloves garlic, minced
            </li>
            <li>
                1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
            </li>
            <li>
                Pinch red pepper flakes
            </li>
            <li>
                2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley 
            </li>
            <li>
                1/2 lemon, zested, optional
            </li>
            <li>
                Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, optional
            </li>
            <hr>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of cold water to a boil over high heat, then 
                salt it generously. Add the pasta and cook, stirring 
                occasionally until al dente, tender but not mushy, about 
                8 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the pasta cooks, combine the garlic, olive oil, 1 teaspoon 
                salt and the red pepper flakes in a large skillet and warm over 
                low heat, stirring occasionally, until the garlic softens and 
                turns golden, about 8 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drain the pasta in a colander set in the sink, reserving about 
                a 1/4 cup of the cooking water. Add the pasta and the reserved 
                water to the garlic mixture. Mix well. Add the parsley and lemon 
                zest (if using). Adjust seasoning, to taste. Transfer to a large 
                serving bowl or divide amongst 4 to 6 dishes. Serve topped with 
                grated cheese, if desired.

            <li>
                1 small red onion, diced
            </li>
            <li>
                1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese (about 4 ounces)
            </li>
            <li>
                1/3 cup pitted green olives, sliced

                2 ears of corn, shucked
            </li>
            <li>
                1 1/4 pounds cube steak

        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat a grill to high. Whisk the olive oil, vinegar, herbs, 
                honey, 3/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a medium 
                bowl. Remove 2 tablespoons of the vinaigrette to a large bowl; 
                set aside. Add the cucumber, tomatoes, red onion, feta and

                about 8 minutes; remove to a cutting board. Meanwhile, season 
                the steaks with salt and pepper. Working in batches if 
                necessary, grill the steaks until the edges start browning, 
                about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 
                about 30 seconds. Transfer to the bowl with the reserved 
                vinaigrette; toss to coat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut off the corn kernels and add to the salad. Serve the steak 
                with the corn salad.

        <h3>Cook's Note</h3>
        <p>
            Cube steak is an inexpensive cut of beef that has been tenderized 
            by machine. If you can't find it, pound a top round steak with 
            a meat mallet.
