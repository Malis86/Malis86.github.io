                <p>
                    Sailor Moon (Japanese: 美少女戦士セーラームーン, Hepburn: 
                    Bishōjo Senshi Sērā Mūn, originally translated as Pretty 
                    Soldier Sailor Moon[1] and later as Pretty Guardian 
                    Sailor Moon[2][3]) is a Japanese manga series written 
                    and illustrated by Naoko Takeuchi. It was originally 
                    serialized in Kodansha's shōjo manga magazine 
                    Nakayoshi from 1991 to 1997; the 60 individual 
                    chapters (later reorganized into 52), along with several 
                    side stories, were compiled in 18 volumes. The series 
                    follows the adventures of a schoolgirl named Usagi 
                    Tsukino as she transforms into the eponymous character
                    to search for a magical artifact, the "Legendary Silver 
                    Crystal" (「幻の銀水晶」, Maboroshi no Ginsuishō, lit. 
                    "Phantom Silver Crystal"). She leads a group of 
                    comrades, the Sailor Soldiers, called Sailor Guardians
                    in later editions, as they battle against villains 
                    to prevent the theft of the Silver Crystal and 
                    the destruction of the Solar System.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The manga was adapted into an anime series produced by 
                    Toei Animation and broadcast in Japan from 1992 to 
                    1997.[4][5] Toei also developed three animated feature 
                    films, a television special, and three short films 
                    based on the anime. A live-action television adaptation, 
                    Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon, aired from 2003 to 2004, 
                    and a second anime series, Sailor Moon Crystal, began 
                    simulcasting in 2014. The manga series was licensed 
                    for an English language release by Kodansha Comics in 
                    North America, and in Australia and New Zealand by 
                    Random House Australia. The entire anime series has 
                    been licensed by Viz Media for an English language 
                    release in North America and by Madman Entertainment

                    Since its release, Sailor Moon has received universal 
                    acclaim, with praise for its art, characterization, 
                    and humor. The manga has sold over 46 million copies 
                    worldwide, making it one of the best-selling manga 
                    series, as well as one of the best-selling shōjo manga 
                    series of all time.[6] The franchise has also generated 
                    $2.5 billion in worldwide merchandise sales.

                <p>
                    One day in Juban, Tokyo, a middle-school student 
                    named Usagi Tsukino befriends Luna, a talking black 
                    cat who gives her a magical brooch enabling her to 
                    transform into Sailor Moon: a guardian destined to 
                    save Earth from the forces of evil. Luna and Usagi 
                    assemble a team of fellow Sailor Guardians to find 
                    their princess and the Silver Crystal. They 
                    encounter the studious Ami Mizuno, who awakens as 
                    Sailor Mercury; Rei Hino, a local Shinto shrine 
                    maiden who awakens as Sailor Mars; Makoto Kino, 
                    a tall and strong transfer student who awakens as 
                    Sailor Jupiter; and Minako Aino, a young aspiring 
                    idol who had awakened as Sailor Venus a few months 
                    prior, accompanied by her talking feline companion 
                    Artemis. Additionally, they befriend Mamoru Chiba, 
                    a high school student who assists them on occasion 
                    as Tuxedo Mask.

                <p>
                    In the first arc, the group battles the Dark Kingdom, 
                    those members attempt to find the Silver Crystal 
                    and free an imprisoned, evil entity called Queen 
                    Metaria. Usagi and her team discover that in their 
                    previous lives, they were members of the ancient 
                    Moon Kingdom in a period of time called the Silver 
                    Millennium. The Dark Kingdom waged war against 
                    them, destroying the Moon Kingdom. Its ruler Queen 
                    Serenity sent her daughter Princess Serenity, 
                    reincarnated as Usagi, along with her protectors 
                    the Sailor Guardians, their feline advisers Luna 
                    and Artemis, and the princess's true love Prince 
                    Endymion, who in turn was reborn as Mamoru.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of the second arc, the Sailor 
                    Guardians meet Usagi and Mamoru's future daughter 
                    Chibiusa, who arrives from a 30th-century version 
                    of Tokyo known as "Crystal Tokyo", which is ruled 
                    by Neo Queen Serenity, Usagi of the future and has 
                    been attacked by the group of villains known as 
                    the Black Moon Clan. During their journey, Sailor 
                    Moon and her friends meet Sailor Pluto, Guardian 
                    of the Time-Space Door. During the climactic battle 
                    of the arc, Sailor Pluto dies trying to save the 
                    sailor soldiers and Chibiusa was brainwashed by 
                    the enemy and turned into the Black Lady, but was 
                    eventually reformed and awakens as a Guardian 
                    herself—Sailor Chibi Moon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The third arc introduces two characters in a 
                    romantic relationship, car-racer Haruka Tenoh 
                    and violinist Michiru Kaioh, who appear as 
                    Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune. Their duty 
                    is to guard the Solar System against external 
                    threats. Physics student Setsuna Meioh, Sailor 
                    Pluto's reincarnation, joins Sailor Uranus and 
                    Sailor Neptune in their mission to kill a mysterious 
                    girl named Hotaru Tomoe, whom they identify as 
                    the Guardian of Destruction Sailor Saturn. 
                    However, when Saturn awakens she joins the final 
                    fight against the main antagonists of the arc, the 
                    Death Busters, sacrificing her life in the process. 
                    With her newly obtained powers as Super Sailor 
                    Moon, Usagi restores the Earth and Hotaru is 
                    reincarnated as a baby.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fourth arc explores the Sailor Guardians' 
                    dreams and nightmares when the villainous 
                    group Dead Moon Circus exploits the Guardians' 
                    deepest fears, invades Elysion (which hosts the 
                    Earth's Golden Kingdom), and captures its high priest 
                    Helios, who turned into a Pegasus and tried to ask 
                    Guardians for help. This storyline also addresses 
                    Mamoru's relevance as protector of the Earth and 
                    owner of the Golden Crystal, the sacred stone of 
                    the Golden Kingdom. Mamoru and all ten of the 
                    reunited Guardians combine their powers, enabling 
                    Usagi to transform into Eternal Sailor Moon and 
                    defeat Dead Moon's leader, Queen Nehelenia.

                    In the final arc the Sailor Starlights from 
                    the Planet Kinmoku, their ruler Princess Kakyuu, 
                    and the mysterious little girl Chibi-Chibi join 
                    Usagi in her fight against Shadow Galactica, a 
                    group of both corrupted and false Sailor Guardians 
                    and led by Sailor Galaxia, who have been rampaging 
                    across the galaxy and killing other Sailor Guardians 
                    to steal their Star Seeds, Sailor Crystals—the essence 
                    of their lives. After Mamoru and all of the main 
                    Solar System Guardians are killed by Shadow 
                    Galactica, Usagi travels to the Galaxy Cauldron, 
                    the birthplace of all Star Seeds of the Milky Way, 
                    in an attempt to revive her loved ones and to 
                    confront Chaos, the source of all strife in the galaxy.

                <h3><b>Creation of Sailor Moon</b></h3>
                <p>
                    Naoko Takeuchi, after working on the 1991 Nami 
                    Akimoto manga Miracle Girls, redeveloped 
                    Sailor Moon from her 1991 manga serial Codename: 
                    Sailor V, which was first published on 
                    August 20, 1991, and featured Sailor Venus as 
                    the main protagonist.[7] Takeuchi wanted to 
                    create a story with a theme about girls in outer 
                    space. While discussing with her editor Fumio 
                    Osano, he suggested the addition of Sailor 
                    fuku.[8] When Codename: Sailor V was proposed 
                    for adaptation into an anime by Toei Animation, 
                    Takeuchi redeveloped the concept so Sailor 
                    Venus became a member of a team.[9][10] The 
                    resulting manga series became a fusion of the 
                    popular magical girl genre and the Super Sentai 
                    series, of which Takeuchi was a fan.[11] 
                    Recurring motifs include astronomy,[8] astrology, 
                    gemology, Greco-Roman mythology,[12] Japanese 
                    elemental themes,[13]: 286  teen fashions,[12][14] 
                    and schoolgirl antics.[14]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Takeuchi later said she planned to kill off the 
                    protagonists, but Osano rejected the notion and 
                    said, "[Sailor Moon] is a shōjo manga!" When 
                    the anime adaptation was produced, the 
                    protagonists were killed in the final battle 
                    with the Dark Kingdom, although they were 
                    revived. Takeuchi resented that she was unable 
                    to do that in her version.[18] Takeuchi also 
                    intended for the Sailor Moon anime adaptation 
                    to last for one season, but due to the immense 
                    popularity, Toei asked Takeuchi to continue the 
                    series. At first, she struggled to develop 
                    another storyline to extend the series. While 
                    discussing with Osano, he suggested the inclusion 
                    of Usagi's daughter from the future, Chibiusa.[18]

                <h3><b>Westernization</b></h3>
                <p>
                    After the Sailor Moon anime was released in North 
                    America and dubbed in English, fans and academics alike 
                    noted that the dub had westernized Sailor Moon from how 
                    it had been released in Japan. In the 1995 English 
                    version of Sailor Moon, the westernization of the 
                    characters is seen in how a majority of the character 
                    names are changed from Japanese to English names.[19] 
                    Sailor Moon's civilian name, Usagi Tsukino, is turned 
                    into Serena.[19] The love interest of Sailor Moon, 
                    Mamoru Chiba, is turned into Darien Shields.[20] The 
                    main theme is changed from a romance ballad discussing 
                    Serena's (Usagi's) eternal love for Darien (Mamoru) to 
                    an anthem focused on Serena's newfound identity as the 
                    superheroine Sailor Moon.[21] Other examples of 
                    westernization referenced by Sailor Moon's audience 
                    included flipping scenes of traffic to have cars drive 
                    on the right side of the road along with the English dub 
                    changing any conversations between characters that 
                    contained lesser-known (in North America at the time) 
                    Japanese cultural references.[22] According to Bandai 
                    America, the company in charge of Sailor Moon 
                    merchandise in the western hemisphere, the approach 
                    to advertising Sailor Moon was to make the show and 
                    super-heroine "'culturally appropriate' for the American 
                    market".[23]

                <h3><b>Manga</b></h3>
                <p>
                    Written and illustrated by Naoko Takeuchi, Sailor 
                    Moon was serialized in the monthly manga anthology 
                    Nakayoshi from December 28, 1991, to February 3, 
                    1997.[7] The side-stories were serialized simultaneously 
                    in RunRun—another of Kodansha's manga magazines.[7] 
                    The 52 individual chapters were published in 18 
                    tankōbon volumes by Kodansha from July 6, 1992, to 
                    April 4, 1997.[24][25] In 2003, the chapters were 
                    re-released in a collection of 12 shinzōban volumes 
                    to coincide with the release of the live-action 
                    series.[26] The manga was retitled Pretty Guardian 
                    Sailor Moon and included new cover art,[27] and revised 
                    dialogue and illustrations. The ten individual short 
                    stories were also released in two volumes.[28][29] 
                    In 2013, the chapters were once again re-released in 
                    10 kanzenban volumes to commemorate the manga's 20th 
                    anniversary, which includes digitally remastered 
                    artwork, new covers and color artwork from its Nakayoshi 
                    run.[30] The books have been enlarged from the typical 
                    Japanese manga size to A5.[31][32] The short stories were 
                    republished in two volumes, with the order of the stories 
                    shuffled. Codename: Sailor V was also included in the 
                    third edition.[32]

                    The Sailor Moon manga was initially licensed for an 
                    English release by Mixx (later Tokyopop) in North 
                    America. The manga was first published as a serial 
                    in MixxZine beginning in 1997, but was later removed 
                    from the magazine and made into a separate, low print 
                    monthly comic to finish the first, second and third arcs. 
                    At the same time, the fourth and fifth arcs were printed 
                    in a secondary magazine called Smile.[33] Pages from 
                    the Tokyopop version of the manga ran daily in the 
                    Japanimation Station, a service accessible to users 
                    of America Online.[34] The series was later collected 
                    into a three-part graphic novel series spanning eighteen 
                    volumes, which were published from December 1, 1998, 
                    to September 18, 2001.[35][36] In May 2005, Tokyopop's 
                    license to the Sailor Moon manga expired, and its 
                    edition went out of print.[37]

                    In 2011, Kodansha Comics announced they had acquired 
                    the license for the Sailor Moon manga and its lead-in 
                    series Codename: Sailor V in English.[38] They 
                    published the twelve volumes of Sailor Moon 
                    simultaneously with the two-volume edition of 
                    Codename Sailor V from September 2011 to 
                    July 2013.[39][40][41] The first of the two related 
                    short story volumes was published on 
                    September 10, 2013;[42] the second was published on 
                    November 26, 2013.[43] At Anime Expo 2017, Kodansha Comics 
                    announced plans to re-release Sailor Moon in 
                    an "Eternal Edition", featuring a new English translation, 
                    new cover artwork by Takeuchi, and color pages from the 
                    manga's original run, printed on extra-large premium 
                    paper.[44][45] The first Eternal Edition volume was 
                    published on September 11, 2018;[46] the tenth and final 
                    volume was published on October 20, 2020.[47] On 
                    July 1, 2019, Kondasha Comics began releasing the Eternal 
                    Editions digitally,[48] following an announcement the day 
                    before about the series being released digitally in ten 
                    different languages.[49] In November 2020, Kodansha 
                    Comics announced plans to re-release the Sailor Moon 
                    manga again as part of their "Naoko Takeuchi 
                    Collection".[50] The company described the new edition 
                    as a "more affordable, portable" version of the Eternal 
                    Edition. The first volume was published on 
                    April 5, 2022,[51] and the last on September 17, 2024.

                    Sailor Moon is one of the most popular manga series of 
                    all time and continues to enjoy high readership worldwide. 
                    More than one million copies of its tankōbon volumes had 
                    been sold in Japan by the end of 1995.[16]: 95  It has 
                    been described as iconic.[134] By the series's 20th 
                    anniversary in 2012, the manga had sold over 35 million 
                    copies in over fifty countries,[135] and the franchise 
                    has generated $2.5 billion in worldwide merchandise 
                    sales as of 1996.[136] By 1995, Sailor Moon toys used 
                    to bring in more than $250 million per year in 
                    Japan.[137] The manga won the Kodansha Manga Award in 
                    1993 for shōjo.[138] The English adaptations of both 
                    the manga and the anime series became the first 
                    successful shōjo title in the United States.[139] 
                    The character of Sailor Moon is recognized as one of the 
                    most important and popular female superheroes of all 
                    time.[140][141][142][143]

                <p>
                    Sailor Moon has also become popular internationally. 
                    Sailor Moon was broadcast in Spain and France beginning 
                    in December 1993; these became the first countries 
                    outside Japan to broadcast the series.[144] It was 
                    later aired in Russia, South Korea, the Philippines, 
                    China, Italy, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia and Hong Kong, 
                    before North America picked up the franchise for 
                    adaptation. In the Philippines, Sailor Moon was one 
                    of its carrier network's main draws, helping it to 
                    become the third-biggest network in the 
                    country.[13]: 10–11  In 2001, the Sailor Moon manga was 
                    Tokyopop's best selling property, outselling the next-best 
                    selling titles by at least a factor of 1.5.[145] In 
                    Diamond Comic Distributors's May 1999 "Graphic Novel 
                    and Trade Paperback" category, Sailor Moon Volume 3 
                    was the best-selling comic book in the United States.[146]

                    Academic Timothy J. Craig attributes Sailor Moon's 
                    international success to three characteristics. First 
                    was the show's magical girl transformation of ordinary 
                    characters into superheroes. Second was the ability of 
                    marketers to establish the international audience's 
                    connection to characters, despite their culture being 
                    Japanese. The third was that the main superhero was 
                    female, something which was still rare in pop culture 
                    in countries like the United States during the 1990s.[147]

                    In his 2007 book Manga: The Complete Guide, Jason Thompson 
                    gave the manga series three stars out of four. He enjoyed 
                    the blending of shōnen and shōjo styles and said the 
                    combat scenes seemed heavily influenced by Saint Seiya, 
                    but shorter and less bloody. He also said the manga 
                    itself appeared similar to Super Sentai television shows. 
                    Thompson found the series fun and entertaining, but said 
                    the repetitive plot lines were a detriment to the title, 
                    which the increasing quality of art could not make up 
                    for; even so, he called the series "sweet, effective 
                    entertainment."[139] Thompson said although the audience 
                    for Sailor Moon is both female and male, Takeuchi does 
                    not use fanservice for males, which would run the risk 
                    of alienating her female audience. Thompson said fight 
                    scenes are not physical and "boil down to their purest 
                    form of a clash of wills", which he says "makes thematic 
                    sense" for the manga.[148]

                    While comparing the manga and anime, Sylvain Durand 
                    thought that the manga artwork is "gorgeous", but its 
                    storytelling is more compressed and erratic and the 
                    anime has more character development. Durand said "the 
                    sense of tragedy is greater" in the manga's telling of 
                    the "fall of the Silver Millennium," giving more detail 
                    about the origins of the Four Kings of Heaven and on 
                    Usagi's final battle against Queen Beryl and Metaria. 
                    Durand said the anime omits information that makes the 
                    story easy to understand, but judges the anime as more 
                    "coherent" with a better balance of comedy and tragedy, 
                    whereas the manga is "more tragic" and focused on Usagi 
                    and Mamoru's romance.[149]

                    For the week of September 11, 2011, to September 17, 2011, 
                    the first volume of the re-released Sailor Moon manga was 
                    the best-selling manga on The New York Times Manga Best 
                    Sellers list, with the first volume of Codename: 
                    Sailor V in second place.[150][151] The first print run 
                    of the first volume sold out after four weeks.[152]

                    In English-speaking countries, Sailor Moon developed a 
                    cult following among anime fans and university 
                    students.[12] Patrick Drazen says the Internet was a new 
                    medium that fans used to communicate and played a role in 
                    the popularity of Sailor Moon.[13]: 281  Fans could use 
                    the Internet to communicate about the series, organize 
                    campaigns to return Sailor Moon to U.S. broadcast, to 
                    share information about episodes that had not yet aired, 
                    or to write fan fiction.[153][154] Gemma Cox of Neo 
                    magazine said part of the series's allure was that fans 
                    communicated via the Internet about the differences 
                    between the dub and the original version.[155]

                    With their dynamic heroines and action-oriented plots, 
                    any credit Sailor Moon for reinvigorating the magical 
                    girl genre. After its success, many similar magical 
                    girl series, including Magic Knight Rayearth, Wedding 
                    Peach, Nurse Angel Ririka SOS, Saint Tail, Cyber Team 
                    in Akihabara, Corrector Yui and Pretty Cure, 
                    emerged.[139]: 199 [156] Sailor Moon has been 
                    called "the biggest breakthrough" in English-dubbed 
                    anime until 1995, when it premiered on YTV,[13]: 10–11  
                    and "the pinnacle of little kid shōjo anime".[157] 
                    Cultural anthropologist Rachel Thorn said that soon 
                    after Sailor Moon, shōjo manga started appearing in 
                    book shops instead of fandom-dominated comic shops.[158] 
                    The series are credited as beginning a wider movement of 
                    girls taking up shōjo manga.[139][159] Canadian librarian 
                    Gilles Poitras defines a generation of anime fans as 
                    those who were introduced to anime by Sailor Moon in 
                    the 1990s, saying they were both much younger than other 
                    fans and were also mostly female.[156]

                    Historian Fred Patten credits Takeuchi with popularizing 
                    the concept of a Super Sentai-like team of magical 
                    girls,[160][161] and Paul Gravett credits the series 
                    with revitalizing the magical girl genre itself.[162] 
                    A reviewer for THEM Anime Reviews also credited the 
                    anime series with changing the genre—its heroine must 
                    use her powers to fight evil, not simply have fun as 
                    previous magical girls had done.[163] The series has 
                    also been compared to Mighty Morphin Power 
                    Rangers,[12][164] Buffy the Vampire 
                    Slayer,[13]: 281 [165][166] and Sabrina the Teenage 
                    Witch.[167] Sailor Moon also influenced the development 
                    of Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir, W.I.T.C.H., 
                    Winx Club, LoliRock, Star vs. the Forces of Evil, 
                    Robot Chicken, Steven Universe, and Totally Spies!.[168]

                    Sailor Moon is associated with the feminist and Girl Power 
                    movements and with empowering its female viewers,[169] 
                    especially regarding the "credible, charismatic and 
                    independent" characterizations of the Sailor 
                    Guardians.[170] Sailor Moon is regarded as empowering to 
                    women and feminism in concept, in particular through the 
                    aggressive nature and strong personalities of the Sailor 
                    Guardians.[171] It is a specific type of feminist concept 
                    where "traditional feminine ideals [are] incorporated 
                    into characters that act in traditionally male 
                    capacities".[171] While the Sailor Guardians are strong, 
                    independent fighters who thwart evil—which is generally 
                    a masculine stereotype—they are also ideally feminized 
                    in the transformation of the Sailor Guardians from teenage 
                    girls into magical girls.[12]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most notable hyper-feminine features of the Sailor 
                    Guardians—and most other females in Japanese girls' 
                    comics—are the girls' thin bodies, long legs, and, in 
                    particular, round, orb-like eyes.[12] Eyes are commonly 
                    known as the primal source within characters where 
                    emotion is evoked—sensitive characters have larger eyes 
                    than insensitive ones.[171] The stereotypical role of 
                    women in Japanese culture is to undertake romantic and 
                    loving feelings;[12] therefore, the prevalence of 
                    hyper-feminine qualities like the openness of the female 
                    eye in Japanese girls' comics is clearly exhibited in 
                    Sailor Moon. Thus, Sailor Moon emphasizes a type of 
                    feminist model by combining traditional masculine action 
                    with traditional female affection through the Sailor 
                    Guardians.[171]
